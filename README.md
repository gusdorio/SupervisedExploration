# Presentation

The current project is intended to make an alysis from basic baskets from the region of Campinas - SÃ¡o Paulo (Brasil), with the final purpose of applying a qualified supervised model which could find usefull insights based on.

# Methodology

For the project, we supposed to divid over some distict actions needed to take, in order to comes with a reliable implementation;

1. We will make an initial and simple statistical analysis over the dataset available (data/);
2. Followed by the insights, we will move with definition of a possible range of questions, to determine how we could use a supervised strategy in order to extract meaningful information from the dataset;
3. With the definitions stated, we will follow to the hands-on implementation of an algorithm from the discipline (or at least a junction of those), to see if we could take the desirable results.
